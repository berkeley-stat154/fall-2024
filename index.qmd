## Description
<ul>
<li> Instructor: Song Mei (songmei [at] berkeley.edu) </li>
<li> Lectures: Tuesday/Thursday 9:30-11:00. Etcheverry 3108. </li>
<li> Office Hours: TBA. Evans 387. </li>
<li> GSI: Ruiqi Zhang (rqzhang [at] berkeley.edu) </li>
<li> Lab sessions Friday  11:00 am - 12:59 pm, Evans 334; 3:00 pm - 4:59 pm, Evans 342. </li>
<li> Office Hours: TBA. </li>
</ul>

This course will focus on statistical/machine learning methods, data analysis/programming skills. Upon completing this course, the students are expected to be able to 1) build baseline models for real world data analysis problems; 2) implement models using programming languages; 3) draw insights/conclusions from models.

## Announcement
<ol>
<li> First class: Aug 29, 2024 (Thursday). </li>
<li> For students who filled in the enrollment appeal forms and concurrent enrollment students: I will process all the petitions on Aug 30. Please come to the first few lectures and decide whether you will take this course.</li>
<li> We will use Ed for discussions and questions. </li>
<li> Please find homework and lecture notes on bCourse under “Files”. </li>
<li> HW policy: There are in total 3 late days that you can use without penalty towards grade throughout the semester. After that, there will be a 10% deduction on grades of a HW for each late day. The least grade can be dropped counting towards total grades. </li>
<li> The lectures will be recorded through Course Capture. The recordings can be found on bCourse under “Media Gallery”. </li>
</ol>


## Grading

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

This is an example of using qmd as the source document with pdf as one target. I've taken out the qmd stuff that doesn't seem to render to pdf.

## Evaluated Python code chunk, with a plot

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.random.normal(size=100)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(x)
plt.show()
np.mean(x)
```


## LaTeX

$$
\theta = \int_0^\infty f(x,\theta)d\theta
$$

## LaTeX macro

> **Warning**: having `include-before-body` in the yaml header of this file, as seemingly needed to enable macros, causes extra space at top of page.

$$
A = X \trans Y
